# This epository contains my QA automation internship testing project based on the Nightwatch-Cucumber framework.
# On this project I have tested the internal Timesheet of the company.  
# Test coverage is: 
  # -login system, where I have tested end to end user behaviour through happy and negative flows
  # -user profile section, where I have tested "profile data update" and "add children functionality" using more complex #Nightwatch.js commands
  # - timesheet section, which is work in progress
